# Digital to Analog to Digital Signal
* ? sample/sec (sample rate), ? bits/sample, more the better
* each amplify level represent a sample

# DSSS vs. FHSS
* DSSS: wifi
* FHSS: bluetooth
 - jumping among different frequency
 - hard to detect

# IEEE Standards

## List of IEEE802.11
802.11 -> 802.11a (not successful, different tech is used compare with first version) -> 802.11b (very popular) -> 802.11g -> 802.11n (2.4 and 5GHz) -> 802.11ac -> 802.11ad (60GHz, cannot pass through the wall)

### 802.11
* introduced in 1997
* defined in (different with LAN in)
 - physical layer
 - MAC sublayer of the Data-Link layer

### 802.11a
* defined OFDM
* operated in less crowded 5GHz bands

### 802.11b

### 802.11g
* heavily adopted in home, SOHO, and enterprise markets
* begining of mobile device

### 802.11h
* for 5GHz in Europe (using many 5GHz, might cause interfrance)
* define DFS and TPC
#### DFS

#### TPC
* reduce the power of radio, avoid interfrance

### 802.11i
* WEP have fixed number of keys, can be backtracked by hacker

### 802.11e
* define MAC method need to meet quality of service (QoS) requirement
 - decide priority of the traffic

### 802.11n
* upgrade from 11g

### 802.11r
* Known as Fast BSS Transition (FT): connect to the new AP first, then disconnect the old AP
* defines faster handoffs between APs using Robust Secure Network(RSN)
* Proposed due to time restraints of roaming for applications such as VoWiFi

### 802.11k
* Provides a means of Raio Resource Measurement (RRM)

### 802.11w
* **management, control, data frame**
* a very common DoS attack occurs at layer 2 using **802.11 management frames**, edit deauthentication or dissasociation frames, shutting down the wireless network
* for delivering managements frames in a secure manner
* 11w management frame
* prevent management frames from being spoofed and prevent denial-of-service attacks (DoS attacks)
* protection for unicast (CCMP from 11i), broadcast and multicast(BIP from 11w) management frames


### 802.11v
* provide the ability to configure client stations wireless from a **central management point** (easier)
 - exchange info for improving the overall performance of the wireless network
* defines Wireless Network Management (WNM)
* BSSID (one AP have 6)
* sleep mode for save power

### 802.11s
* Mesh Network

### 802.11ac
* user 5 GHz bands
* wider channels - 80 MHz and 160 MHz
* improved MIMO and beamforming: uses mu-MIMO and null data packet beamforming

### 802.11ad
* defines Very High Throughput(VHT) enhancements
* using higher frequency 60 GHz band
* significantly less range
* may require new encryption mechanisms due to higher data rates

### 802.11af
* Allows the use of Wi-Fi in the newly opened TV whitespace frequencies between 54 MHz and 790 MHz
* Lower frequencies would require lower data rates
* Potential for long-distance outdoor transmissions 

### 802.11ah
* define the use of Wi-Fi in frequencies below 1 GHz
* would have greater range
* enhance IoT or M2M communication
