# Media Access
* one AP to one channel (same frequency)
* use different time slot for different user
- that's why wifi is slow
* wired internet: detect and avoid collision
* wireless internet: no collision
## CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)
![Example](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w8-1.png)
* random exponential backoff: for differ the user start at the same time
### CSMA/CA
![Example](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w8-2.png)
### CSMA/CA vs. CSMA/CD

## Explicit Acknowledgement (ACK)
* if CRC on received frame fails, receiving radio will not send a ACK
* 802.11 cannot detect if a collision occurs
## (DCG)
* Main components:
### Interframe Spacing (IFS)
* time period between wireless transmissions
* five types of IFS
- low priority = more wait time
### Duration/ID Field
* field in the MAC header of an 802.11 unicast frame
- time in microseconds to transmit
* other station alter their transmit time based on this
### carrier sense
* physical
- performed by stations not transmitting or receiving
- listening for any 802.11 traffic
* virtual
- use a logical timer (NAV)
- stations cannot transmit unless the nav value is 0
### random back-off timer
* final timer used prior to transmission
## PCF
* **optional** 802.11 media access method
## HCF
* combined capabilities from DCF and PCF
* frame brust
- several frames then one ACK (old is one frame with one ACK)
## Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM)

# 802.11 MAC Architecture
* MAC for wired and wireless network are different
* put 802.3 frame into 802.11 frame (larger)
## Data Link Layer
* it has two sublayers
- Logical Link Control (LLC)
- Media Access Control (MAC)
* MSDU
* MPDU

## Physical Layer
* two sublayers
### Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP)
* PSDU
* PPDU
### Physical Media Dependent (PMD)
* Preamble and PHY header: for transmit
## 802.11 Frame
* Frame Types:
### Management Frame
* association/reassociation request and response
* beacon: consist of info of the devices
#### Passive and Active Scanning
* passive scanning
* active scanning station use Probe Request and Response Frames
### Control Frame
#### CTS-to-Self
* RTS/CTS reduce the data rate
* it has less overhead than RTS/CTS
### Data Frame
* Pure data
* null data
* combine with other functions
* contains the MSDU
