# Quiz
* Not the function of Application layer: data translation and code formatting
* different MAC address among hops: stripped of the header every hop
* ICMP: 1
* TCP: 6
* local socket: dst ip : dst port num
* DHCP port num: 67, 68
- steps of obstaning IP configuration: discovery, offer, request, acknowledgement
* FTP: 20 (data), 21 (control)
* DNS: a hierarchical systen and uses **recursive** lookup
* hub cannot divide collision domain, switch can

# Subnetting
## 192.168.1.17/28
* subnet address: 192.168.1.16
* total ip addresses: 2^4 = 16
* subnet mask: 255.255.255.(128+64+32+16), /28
* range of IP addresses: 192.168.1.16 - 192.168.1.31
```
192 168 1   00010001
255 255 255 11110000
192 168 1   00010000
```
* broadcast address: 192.168.1.31
* usable IP address: 192.168.1.17 - 192.168.1.30

# VLSM
* pick the default gateway for the LAN: usually pick first or last usable IP address
* WAN don't need to have gateway since is among routers
- /30 for each WAN
- 1 for each interface (2 in total)
