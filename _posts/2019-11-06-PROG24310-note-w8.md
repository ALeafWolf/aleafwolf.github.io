# structures
* struct: a grouping of variables together into single type
* can have multiple struct in one class
* cannot initial the data for the variables inside the struct
```
struct aStruct{
    type member1;
    type member2;
}
void main(){
    struct aStruct variableName;
}
```
# typedef
* custom data type
```
typedef struct{
    int id;
    int year;
    char grade;
} student_t;
```

* passing a structure as an argument is passed-by-value
- so for changing the variables inside this struct, pass a pointer
* . have higher priority than *
* p -> name is same as (*p).name

# Unions
* a variable that stores objects of different types
* variables inside it shard the same block of memory

# Memory Alignment and Padding
* __**the total size of struct must able to be divided by the largest variable's size**__

# OO
## Data decompression
## Data abstraction

# encapsulation vs abstraction
* data abstraction: determined to show how much necessary details
* encapsulation: pratically implementation of data hiding, focus on what to hide

# Software reuse and independence
* modify program behavior with minimal changes to existing code
* reuse software components as much as possible
* maintain the independence of different components
## four ways
* extension
 - ex. add new method
* redefinition
- ex. 
* abstraction
* polymorphism
- ex. the method that able to use with various data type

## constructor and destructors in c++
*
