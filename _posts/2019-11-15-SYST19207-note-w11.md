# Intel IA-32
* add new Registers
- FPU: floating point
- SIMD
* Register: EAX, EBX, EIP
- have extra 'E' in front of register name
# Intel 80286
* still being used by the harddisk controller

# Cache Memory
* for faster memory access
* size is relatively small
- only need to put frequently used data in
## Write-back system
* faster
* data is written to the next level of memory only when it's evited

## Write-through system
* data is writen to all levels whenever it is updated

# Intel 80286
* FPC: for floating point calculationg
- for faster data processing, covert data into floating point

# Instruction Level Parallel Hazard
## Data Hazards
## Branch Hazards
* add branch prediction

# Scheduling Unit
# Out-of-order Execution
# Retirement Unit

# Pipeline Architecture
* pipelined cycle time = unpipelined cycle time / number of pipelineStages + pipeline latch latency

# Vector Data processing speed
* **on final**

# Hyper-Threading
* has two sets of registers
* for tracking paraell ...
