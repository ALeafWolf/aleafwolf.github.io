1. Differences between cellular and WLAN systems

 Cellular | WLAN 
 --- | ---
 transmit through radio towers, network for mobile phone | transmitt with the help of Acess point and NIC on PC, extension of a wired LAN

2. Quadruple Play? Digital convergence?
* Quadruple Play = broadband internet access + television + telephone + **wireless service**
* Digital convergence = the power of digital devices to combine voice, video and text processing capabilities

3. Function of an antenna in wireless communication systems?
* bi-directional passive amplifier
 - focus both transmitted and received signals

4. Mobile first?
* start the product design from the mobile end
 - more restrictions
 - then expand its features to create a tablet/desktop version

5. main elements of cellular system
* the web consists of several cell sites/base transceiver stations

6. stakeholders of mobile computing?
* everyone

7. difference of functions/responsibilities of standardization bodies and regulatory bodies


8. scope of work of IEEE and IETF

9. main functions of industry alliances

10. draw the traditional 3-tier hierarchical network model, descripe the main functions of each tier, IEEE 802.11 belong to?

* Access Layer: highlighted grants end devices access to the network (switchers).
 - **layer 2 switching** (IEEE 802.11)
 - port security
 - QoS classification and marking and trust boundaries
* Distribution Layer: aggregates the data received from the access layer switches before it's transmitted to the core layer for routing to its final destination
 - defines policy for the network by implementing access list and other filters to provide **boundary definition**
* Core Layer: network backbone, has several very expansive router, switch packets as fast as possible

11. three independent characteristics of RF wave
* Amplitude
* Frequency
* Wavelength
* Phase

12. relation between frequency and wavelength
* represent the same characteristics, just in different representation
* Î» = c/f
 - c = 3x10^8 m/sec

13. carrier, modulating and modulated signal

14. explain PSK modulation with diagram
* change of phase represents 0/1
* lack of phase change represents 1/0

15. what cause signal loss or distortion based om RF signal behaviour
* absorption
* distance
* negative effects of multipath

16. main causes of signal loss (attenuation) in a communication circuit (electrical)
* cable
* impedance mismatch
* lightning arrestors
* connectors
* signal attenuators

17. multipath? delay spread?
* caused by refection of RF signal
 - strikes an object which does not absorb and diffract the signal

18. Intersymbol interference (ISI)?

19. Main components of an RF communication link? understand by IR and EIRP

20. SNR? Noise Floor? Receive Sensitivity?

21. Purpose of doing Link Budget exercise before setting up a communication link?
