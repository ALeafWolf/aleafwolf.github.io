## About me

Hoi! This is LeafWolf, you can just call me Leaf.

## Game

My Steam account ----> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/thesoulwolf/">Here</a>

I mainly focus on the games in PC and Mobile platform (recently).

My taste for the game is kinda... unpredictable. As long as the game can get my interest, I'll spend time on it, regardless the graphic, game type, etc.

### PC

Here are some of the games listed based on my play time on Steam, just as a sample for my game taste owo:
