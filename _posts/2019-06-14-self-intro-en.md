## About me

Hoi! This is LeafWolf, you can just call me Leaf.

Born in Chinese Mainland, currently live in Canada.

Native language is Mandarin, fluent(?) in English, and my Japanese is... fluent in Hiragana ~~I cannot even read all Katakana uwu~~.

## Favourite Character/Ship

Heshikiri Hasebe from Touken Ranbu is my first, and the only favourite character for now. (\*╹▽╹*)

And I like all ships that related to him ~~at least I didn't find one I don't like w~~. Includes and not limit to:

* **saniheshi** (both female and male sani)

* heshisani

* heshiheshi

* kuriheshi

* mitsuheshi

* nihonheshi

* ......


## Game

I mainly focus on the games in PC and Mobile platform (recently).

My taste for the game is kinda... unpredictable. As long as the game can get my interest, I'll spend time on it, regardless the graphic, game type, etc.

### PC

List of the game based on my play time on Steam, just as a sample for my game taste owo:
