# Imperative Programming
## Turing Complete
* integer variables, values, operations (data abstraction)
* assignments
* conditions (control abstraction)
* **an imperative language is said to be Turing Complete if it provides an effective basis for implementing any algorithm that can be designed**
## Procedural abstraction
* allows the programmer to be concerned mainly with a function interface
* ignoring the details of how it is computed

# Expressions and Statements
## Side Effect
* order of operation matter, cause side effect
* permenent change of state
## Expression
* a combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets
* it yields a value
* ex. 2 + 3 * 4
* basic expressions consist of **literals** and **identifiers**
* complex expression
* levels of operators differ languages
* **return a value and produces no side effect**
## Statement
* a syntactic unit of an imperative programming language that expresses some **action** to be carried out
- these actions are called side-effects
* ex. x = 2 + 3 * 4
* **returns no value and executed for its side effects**
* if-statement
 - dangling-else problem
* case-statement / switch-statement
* iteration statement
 - for loops
 - while, do-while loops
## Assignment statement
* target = expression
* **Copy semantics**: expression is evaluated to a **value**, which is copied to the target; used by imperative languages (value-oriented languages)
- ex. C
* **Reference semantics**: expression is evaluated to an **object**, which pointer is copied to the target; (reference-oriented languages)
- ex. most functional languages
* java deliberately in-between
- built-in types are values
- user-defined types are objects - reference
## Side Effects
* some permanent state change caused by execution of a function or statement
 - in program memory, non-local variables, input and output
* **are fundaments to the whole Von Neumann Model of Computing**
* In pure functional, logic and dataflow languages, there should be **no side effects**
## Expression vs Statement-oriented languages
* Expression-oriented
 - functional languages (List, Scheme, ML)
* Statement-oriented
 - most imperative languages
* C halfway in-between
## C shorthand statements
* exp1?exp2:exp3 equals to
```
if(exp1){
    exp2
}else{
    exp3
}
```
## C if statements
* [dangling else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else) : an optional else clause in an if–then(–else) statement results in nested conditionals being ambiguous.
- avoid it!
* C enforce else is associated with the __closest__ if which does not already have an else part
## Short-circuit Evaluation
* avoid it
## The GOTO Controversy
* unnecessary and harmful in C 
## Loop Exits
* structured and unstructured exit
- one entry point and one exit point vs. multiple exit point and doesn't have a built-in condition check
* avoid **unstructured loop**
## Recursion
* break the task into smaller subtasks
### Head recursion
* the recursive call occurs at the beginning of a method, it saves the state before jumping into the next recursive call
### Tail recursion
* no computation follows recursive call
* faster than head: no need to contain the changed state

# Functions and Procedures
* blocks whoes execution is deferred and whose interfaces are clearly specified
* Functions produce a value only and have no side effect
- expressions
* Procedures produce no value only and operate by producing side effects
- statements

# Storage class in C
* auto: default storage class for all local variables
* register: define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM
- variable that require **quick access** ex. counters
* static: keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program
* extern: give a reference of a global variable that is visiable to ALL the program files

# Type casting and Type conversion in C
* coversion: done automatically
* casting: done explicitly
