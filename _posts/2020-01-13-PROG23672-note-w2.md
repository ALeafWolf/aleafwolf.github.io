## Analyze the algorithms
* performance
* complexity
- big O
* efficiency
- time ex. speed of CPU
- space ex. usage of memory

## Pseudocode
* ex. factorial
```
Algorithm factorial(n)
    Input n as int and > 0
    Output factorial of n as int

solution 1:
    fact = 1
    for i = 1 to n-1
        fact *= i
    return fact

solution 2:
    set fact to 1
    iterate i from 1 to n
        multiply fact by i
    return fact
```
### operation count
```
for i <- 1 to n - 1 do              1+n times
```
* 1 for assign i to 1, n-1 of looping, 1 for i > n-1 and quick the loop
```
increment counter i                 2(n-1) times
```
* increment i n-1 times, assign i for n-1 times

### base case and worst case
* n is the input size
* smaller of the output of operation of n, the faster algorithm is 

```
count = 0                            1
for i = 1 to n                       n + 2
    if (A[i] mod 2 == 0)             3n
        count++                      2n

return count                         1

worst case: 6n + 4
```

```
for i = 1 to n                       n + 2
    for j = 1 to n                   n + 2
        print("")                    n * n = n^2
```

* ex for get rid of constant, the big O is n^2 (loop) * n^2 (calling in one loop) = n^4
```
for i = 1 to n do                    n
    for j = 0 to n do                n
        {
            (n times)                n + n^2 = n ^ 2
            (n^2 times)
        }
```

## big O
* simpliest: O(1)
* sqrt n < log n < n
