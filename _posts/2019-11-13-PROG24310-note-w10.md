# Hierarchical class

## Algorithmic patterns
## Software design patterns
# Abstraction
## Abstract class
* have at least one pure abstract method
* in C++ decleared as Virtual
* pure virtual method:
```
//pure, child class must implement
virtual void AbstractMemberFunction() = 0
//not pure, optional to implement in child class
virtual void NotAbstractMemberFunction();
```

# Interface vs. abstract class
## abstract class
* inherent
- class must follow the order of the inherent
* modelling: child class must implemnt the abstract methods from the abstract class 
# Interface
* only describe the behaviour, no attribute in it
* used for communication between similar looking or different classes implementing the interface
- any class can implement an interface
* in C++ interfaces are implemented using pure abstract classes
