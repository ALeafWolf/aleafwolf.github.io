# Frequency bands
## Unlicensed Frequency
![Summary chart](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w6-1.png)
### Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM)
#### Three spots
* 900 MHz band: 902 - 928 MHz
 - 2G
 - most developed country get rid of this
* 2.4 GHz band: 2.4 - 2.5 GHz
 - most common Wi-Fi band
* 5.8 GHz band: 5.725 - 5.875 GHz
 - **commonly confused with the UNII-3 band, which spans from 5.725 - 5.825**
### Unlicensed Personal Communications Systems
### Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)
* contains three 5 GHz bands (plus a sub band)
* all are 100 MHz wide and have 4 channels except the sub band
#### UNII 1 (Lower)
* 5.15 GHz to 5.25 GHz
* **typically used indoors**
#### UNII 2 (Middle)
* 5.25 GHz to 5.35 GHz
 - 255 MHz wide
 - 11 channels
* FCC Maximum 250mW IR
 - differ in different country
##### UNII 2 Extended
* 5.47 GHz to 5.725 GHz
#### UNII 3 (Upper)
### Milimeter Wave
* unusually for long distance
## Future Wi-Fi Frequencies
* 2.4 GHz ISM band is the dominant license-free frequency band
* 5 GHz continues to grow due to:
 - overcrowding of 2.4 GHz band
 - wider and have more channels
 - can use the channel bonding benefit of 802.11n
### 60 GHz
* Proposed by 802.11ad draft amendment
* Potential speeds of up to 7 Gbps
### WiGiG
* designated by the Wi-Fi Alliance
* to test interoperability of products that operate in the 60 GHz band
### White-Fi
* proposed by 802.11af draft amendment
* describes the use of Wi-Fi in the unused television RF spectrum (**white space**)
## Narrowband
* human can heard the voice from 20 Hz to 20 KHz
* human's voice is in the range of 30 Hz to 3KHz

## Spread Spectrum
* uses more bandwidth than is necessary to carry its data
* using low power for transmit
* to avoid losing all info while deal with the interfare

## Multipath Interference
* CDMA and MIMO use multipath as benefit
## FHSS
* transmits bursts of narrowband signal over a wide band
 - transmit in random frequency
 - stop signal being jammed
 - slowed and more secure
* used by Bluetooth

* Dwell time: duration of sending signal
* Hop time: the time transmit spend of switching frequency
## DSSS
* Uses chipping/spreading to convert data bits into a sequence
### Simple Spread Spectrum
#### Transmitter

#### Receiver

## OFDM
* Divides the whole bandwidth into subcarriers

## 2.4 GHz Channels
* Divided into 14 channels by 802.11-2007 standard
![2.4](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w6-6.png)

## 5 GHz Channels
* more channels, less overlapping

### Throughput vs. Bandwidth
* Bandwidth = data rate
* actual throughput is 50% or less of the data rate due to half-duplex nature of 802.11
 - multi direction
* more users sharing the link, less throughput each person got
#### Throughput
* data throughput depend on
- Frequency bandwidth
- data encoding
- modulation
- medium contention
- encryption
- number of current users
