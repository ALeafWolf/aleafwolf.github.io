# Web Application Security
## OWASP
* Estimating associated risk to organization is just as important as identifying risks
* System for rating risks:
 - saves time
 - eliminates agruing about priorities
 - ensures focus is on major risks
### Risk Rating Methodology
#### Step 1: Identify a Risk
* Tester gathers info about the:
 - threat agent involved (hacker)
 - attack that will be used
 - vulnerability involved
 - impact of a successful exploit on the organization
#### Step 2: Factors for estimating Like likelihood
* How likely a particular vulnerability is to be identified by an attacker
 - rating: low, medium or high
##### **Threat Agent Factors**:
* skill level
* motive
* opportunity
* size
##### **Vulnerability Factors**:
* ease of discovery
* ease of exploit
* awareness
* instrusion detection
#### Step 3: Factors for Estimating Impact
##### Technical impact (on application, data it uses, and functions it provides):
* loss of confidentiality
- how much data could be disclosed and how sensitive is it
* loss of integrity
* loss of availability
* loss of accountability
- threat agents' actions traceable to an individual?
##### Bussiness impact (on business and company operating the application):
* financial damage
* reputation damage
* non-compliance (not follow the rule)
* privacy violation
#### Step 4: Determining Severity of the Risk
* Calculate the overall severity of the risk (0~9)
#### Step 5: Deciding What to Fix
* Prioritize risks
* fix most severe risks first
* not all risks are worth fixing (**financial fraud**)
#### Step 6: Customizing Your Risk Rating Model
* a risk ranking framework that is customizable is critical for adoption
 - adding factors
 - customizing options
 - weighing factors

## Classification and Prioritization
* risk identification
### Phase 3
#### Classify
* further subdivide each category
* Data classification scheme
 - sensitivity
 - security priority of the data
 - the devices that store, transmit
 - process the data
* Data classification categories
 - confidential
 - internal
 - public
#### Value
#### Prioritization
* Weighted foctor analysis
### Phase 4: Identify and Priorize Threats
### Phase 5: Specify Asset Vulnerabilities

## TOP 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks
### SQL Injection Deme
* injecting SQL code into a database
* DB executes the code & returns results to hacker
### Broken Authentication and Sesion Management
* user authentication credentials not protected when stored
* predictable login credentials
* sessions IDs: exposed in the URL, vulnerable to session fixation attacks
* session value: does not timeout, does not get invalidated after logout
* Session IDs are not rotated after successful login
* passwords, session IDs and other credentials are sent over unencrypted connection
### Insecure Direct Object References
* ex:
- App allows export data to a spreadsheet and download
- applicaiton create a file, and the client browser is redirected to the exported file by name
- the filename used to store the exported data is the user id followed by a integer, suggesting a counter
- if we copy and change the filename to a different user id, then see if we can download a file
- might need to submit many URLs until we find another user's export file
### Security Misconfiguration
* ex: the app server admin console is auto matically installed and not moved
- default accounts are not changed
* risk: attacker discovers the standard admin pages on your server, logs in with default passwords and takes over
### Broken access control
* Restrictions on what authenticated user are allowed to do are not properly enforced
* attackers can exploit these flaws to access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, or use unauthorized functions

## Browser Security
* protects networked data and computer systems from privacy breaches or malware
* security exploits often use JS
### Dual mode and multimode operations
* it allows OS to protect itself and other system components
- user mode and kernel mode
* mode bit: provided by hardware
- provides ability to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code
* OS breached and malware is reading/modifying the browser memory space in privileged mode
* malware may be running as background process

## Primary Defence Approaches
* Salt passwords: add randominess while encrypt the password
* access cotrol matrix
