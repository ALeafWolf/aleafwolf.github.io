# Cryptology
## Cypher Methods
* Plaintext can be encrypted via two methods:
### bit stream
* Encryption algorithm
* Supposed to employ a purely random key
 - Key >= plaintext length
* can be fully immune to brute force attacks
### block stream
* something
### Substitution cipher
* use one character to replace the other
* **Monoalphabetic substitution**: uses only one alphabet during encryption process
* **Polyalphabetic substitution**: use two or more alphabets
```
text -> wkgf
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

DEFGHIJKLMNOPKRSTUV"W"XYZABC (cha1)

GHIJ"K"LMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCEDF (cha2)

JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEF"G"HI (cha3)

MNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDE"F"GHIJKL (cha4)
```
#### Vigenere cipher
* advenced substitution cipher
* made up of 26 distinct cipher alphabet

* Cipher Text: ATCVEINLDNIKEYMWGE
* Weakness: same letter for plaintext message and cipher text
 - minimize weakness: avoid of have A in keyword

#### Transposition cipher
* key pattern: 8->3, 7->6, 6->2, 5->7, 4->5, 3->1, 2->8, 1->4
* place letters from right to left, then rearrange positions based on key pattern

#### Exclusive OR(XOR)
* Plaintext: CAT, Key: VVV
* switch them to ASCII binary representation

#### Vernam Cipher

# Hash Functions
## Hash Algorithms
* public functions that create hash value, which used to encrypt message

# Crytographic Algorithms
## Symmetric
* require same "secret key" to encipher and decipher message
* also known as private-key encryption
* DES, 3DES
* AES: developed to replace both DES and 3DES
* size (equal to strength) of cryptovariable or key is important
## Asymmetric
* also known as public-key encryption
* use two different, related keys, one private one public
- either key can encrypt of decrypt a message
- key A encrypt message, then B can decrypt

# Cryptographic Tools
## Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)
* it based on public-key cryptosystems
## Certificate Authority

## Steganography
* art of secret writing
* hides info within files that contain digital pictures or other images
