# Double linked list
* has two pointer: prev and next node

## Data set
* sorted
* unsorted

# Binary Tree
* each internal node has at most two children (left and right)
* the children of a node are an ordered pair
* proper binary tree: each node have 0 or 2 children
## Traversal
### Pre order
* parent -> children
* prefix (arithmetic expression)
- use stack, push all in and pop
### In Order
* left -> root -> right
* infix (arithmetic expression)
### Post Order
* children -> parent
* postfix (arithmetic expression)
- use stack

### delete from left/right
* choose the max/min value of the left/right sub tree
* swap it with the deleted value
* delete the swaped node
