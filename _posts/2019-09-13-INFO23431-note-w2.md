# Threat to Infomation Assets
* Threat & Threat agent
* Attack
* Exploit: a vulnerbility that can be used to cause a loss to an asset
 - ex. an unknown backdoor
* Vulnerbility: a potential weakness in an asset ot its defensive control system
* Protecting information assets
* Making sound information security decisions
 - Inform management about threat to: 
  - people
  - applications
  - data
  - information systems
* Top 5 threats on info security
 - hackers
 - current and former employees
 - foreign countries
 - hackivists and other adctivities
 - organized crime
* Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)
 - Tool to understand attacks
 - https://capec.mitre.org/
 - run by US gevernment
* Attack Patterns
 - common attributes and approaches utilized to exploit known weaknesses

# Types of Attacks on Information Assets
* 12 types:
 - compromises to intellectual property
 - deviations in quality of service
 - espionage or trespass
 - forces of nature
 - human error or failure
 - information extortion
 - sabotage of vandalism
 - software attacks
 - technical hardware failures or errors
 - technical software failures or errors
 - technological obsolescence
 - theft
* Each organization must prioritize threats based on:
 - particular security situation in which it operates
 - its organizational strategy regarding risk
 - exposure level of its assets
* Many of attack could fall under more than 1 attack category
## Compromises to intellectual property
* Intellectual Property (IP): creation, ownership and control of original ideas as well as the representation of those ideas
 - ex. algorim of google search
 - Unauthorized use of IP is an information security threat
## Software Piracy
* The most common IP breaches involve SW piracy
* two watch dot organizations investigate SW abuse:
 - SIIA
 - BSA
* Copyright law with technical security mechanisem
## Deviations in quality of service
* Availability disruption
* Downtime: percentage of time a service in unavilable
* Service Level Aggreement(SLA)
 - expected level of service
 - provisions for minimum availability and penalties or remediation procedures for downtime
* External support organizations reply on:
 - internet
 - power grid
 - phone
 - ...
* Internet service, communications, and power irregularities dramatically affect the availability of information and systems
## Espionage or Trespass
* Access of protected information by unauthorized individuals
* Competitive intelligence(legal) vs. industrial expionage(illegal)
 - ex. market research vs. Hacking FB
* Hackers use skill, guile, or graud to bypass controls protecting others' information
* Shoulder surfing (no technology required)
* Expert vs Unskilled hacker
 - develop own software script and program exploits or not
 - fully understand the systems they hack or not
* Other terms for system rule breakers:
 - cracker: cracks or removes software protection designed to prevent unauthorized duplication. ex. guess password
 - phreaker: hacks the public telephone system to make free calls or disrupt services
* Password attacks and hot to prevent then:
 - cracking
 - brute force: have a software trying every password combunation
 - dictionary: try words combunation for password
 - rainbow tables: contain many hash value which is for encrypt password
  - prevent by sorting, generate a random value, add it to the password, then encrypt it
 - social engineering: pretend other ppl in order to get info
  - prevent it by training employee to not leak sensetive info to other, like check id to verify
## Forces of nature
* Can present some of the most dangerous threat
* organizations must implement controls to limit damage and prepare contingency plans for continued operations
* ex. static electricity, earchquake...
## Human error or failure
* Set policies to let ppl know the consequence of unproper operation
* Information characteristics:
 - availability
 - accuracy
 - authenticity
 - confidentiality
 - integrity
 - utility
 - possession
* block-chain: decentralize
* behaviour cause mistakes impact: **(matched one or more of the above characteristics)**
 - revelation of classified data
 - entry of erroneous date
 - accidental data deletion or modification
 - data storage in unprotected areas
 - failure to protect information
* Social engineering
 - phishing
 - advance-fee fraud
## Information Extortion
* attacker steals information from a computer system and demands compensation for its return or nondisclosure
 - also known as **cyberextortion** and **ransomeware**
* commonly done in credit card number theft
## Sabotage of vandalism
* defacing origanzation's website for many reason rather than money
* Cyberterrorist: attacks systems for terrorists activities via networks or internet pathways
* Cyberwarfare: Formerly sanctioned offensive operations conducted by a government or state against information or systems of another government or state
## Software attacks
* Malware
 - overwhelm the processing capabilities of online systems
 - to gain access to protected systems via hidden means
 - the attack occur when
  - an individual or a group
  - designs and deploys software to attack a system
 - ex:
  - virus
  - worms
  - Trojan horses
