# Threat to Infomation Assets
* Threat & Threat agent
* Attack
* Exploit: a vulnerbility that can be used to cause a loss to an asset
 - ex. an unknown backdoor
* Vulnerbility: a potential weakness in an asset ot its defensive control system
* Protecting information assets
* Making sound information security decisions
 - Inform management about threat to: 
  - people
  - applications
  - data
  - information systems
* Top 5 threats on info security
 - hackers
 - current and former employees
 - foreign countries
 - hackivists and other adctivities
 - organized crime
* Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)
 - Tool to understand attacks
 - https://capec.mitre.org/
 - run by US gevernment
* Attack Patterns
 - common attributes and approaches utilized to exploit known weaknesses

# Types of Attacks on Information Assets
* 12 types:
 - compromises to intellectual property
 - deviations in quality of service
 - espionage or trespass
 - forces of nature
 - human error or failure
 - information extortion
 - sabotage of vandalism
 - software attacks
 - technical hardware failures or errors
 - technical software failures or errors
 - technological obsolescence
 - theft
* Each organization must prioritize threats based on:
 - particular security situation in which it operates
 - its organizational strategy regarding risk
 - exposure level of its assets
* Many of attack could fall under more than 1 attack category

## Compromises to intellectual property
* Intellectual Property (IP): creation, ownership and control of original ideas as well as the representation of those ideas
 - ex. algorim of google search
 - Unauthorized use of IP is an information security threat

## Software Piracy
* The most common IP breaches involve SW piracy
* two watch dot organizations investigate SW abuse:
 - SIIA
 - BSA
* Copyright law with technical security mechanisem

## Deviations in quality of service
* Availability disruption
* Downtime: percentage of time a service in unavilable
* Service Level Aggreement(SLA)
 - expected level of service
 - provisions for minimum availability and penalties or remediation procedures for downtime
* External support organizations reply on:
 - internet
 - power grid
 - phone
 - ...
* Internet service, communications, and power irregularities dramatically affect the availability of information and systems

## Espionage or Trespass
* Access of protected information by unauthorized individuals
* Competitive intelligence(legal) vs. industrial expionage(illegal)
 - ex. market research vs. Hacking FB
* Hackers use skill, guile, or graud to bypass controls protecting others' information
* Shoulder surfing (no technology required)
* Expert vs Unskilled hacker
 - develop own software script and program exploits or not
 - fully understand the systems they hack or not
* Other terms for system rule breakers:
 - cracker: cracks or removes software protection designed to prevent unauthorized duplication. ex. guess password
 - phreaker: hacks the public telephone system to make free calls or disrupt services
* Password attacks and hot to prevent then:
 - cracking
 - brute force: have a software trying every password combunation
 - dictionary: try words combunation for password
 - rainbow tables: contain many hash value which is for encrypt password
  - prevent by sorting, generate a random value, add it to the password, then encrypt it
 - social engineering: pretend other ppl in order to get info
  - prevent it by training employee to not leak sensetive info to other, like check id to verify

## Forces of nature
* Can present some of the most dangerous threat
* organizations must implement controls to limit damage and prepare contingency plans for continued operations
* ex. static electricity, earchquake...

## Human error or failure
* Set policies to let ppl know the consequence of unproper operation
* Information characteristics:
 - availability
 - accuracy
 - authenticity: real or not
 - confidentiality
 - integrity: complete or not
 - utility
 - possession: ownership
* block-chain: decentralize
* behaviour cause mistakes impact: **(matched one or more of the above characteristics)**
 - revelation of classified data
 - entry of erroneous date
 - accidental data deletion or modification
 - data storage in unprotected areas
 - failure to protect information
* Social engineering
 - phishing: attempt to gain personal/confidential info; redirect user to third-party site with hidden codes
 - advance-fee fraud: indicate the recipient who only require small amount of info to proceed money transfer

## Information Extortion
* attacker steals information from a computer system and demands compensation for its return or nondisclosure
 - also known as **cyberextortion** and **ransomeware**
* commonly done in credit card number theft

## Sabotage of vandalism
* defacing origanzation's website for many reason rather than money
* Cyberterrorist: attacks systems for terrorists activities via networks or internet pathways
* Cyberwarfare: Formerly sanctioned offensive operations conducted by a government or state against information or systems of another government or state

## Software attacks
### Malware
 - overwhelm the processing capabilities of online systems
 - to gain access to protected systems via hidden means
 - the attack occur when
  - an individual or a group
  - designs and deploys software to attack a system
 - ex:
  - virus: contain code segments, attach to existing program, take control of access
  - worms
  - Trojan horses
### Email Attacks
* Mail bombing (DoS): routes large puantities of email to owverwhelm the receiver
* Spam: more like a nuisance
 - posibility solution: block-chain (decentralizing, micro transaction)
* Packet sniffer: monitors data traveling over network, used for both legitimate management purposes, and stealing information from a network
* Spoofing: gain unauthorized access, intruder assumes a trusted IP address
* **communication and interception attacks**
![IP Spoofing Attack](/assets/images/post_images/info23431-w3-1.png)
* Pharming: use fear to redirect user to the illegitimate site to obtaining the private info
* Man-in-the-middle: monitors the network packets, modifies them, and inserts them back to the network

## Technical Hardware Failures or Errors
* occur when a manufacturer distributes equipment containing a known or unknown flaw
* the system would perform outside of expected parameters
* teminal and intermittent errors

## Technical Software Failures or Errors
* Combinations of certain software and hardware can reveal new software bugs

### neglecting change control
* used in development process
* ensure the authorized changes are introduced

### Improper file access
* change the path of the file that program required and focus to use other program

* Problem areas:
 - trusting network address resolution
 - unauthenticated key exchange
 - use of magic URLs and hidden forms: get and post for form
 - use of weak password-based systems
 - poor usability

## Technological Obsolescenece
* antiquated/outdated infrastructure can lead to unreliable, untrustworthy systems
* proper managerial planning should prevent technology obsolescenece

## Theft
* illegal taking of another's physical, electronic, or intellectual property
* Physical and electronic theft
