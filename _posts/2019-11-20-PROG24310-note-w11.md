# Subtype Polymorphism
## Upcasting
* cast up the inheritance hierarchy from a subtype to a super type
```
Dog dog;
dog = new HoundDog();
dog = new Beagle();
dog = new Bassett();
```
## Binding

# Coercion
* an impicit type conversion
```
//explict type conversion
int x;
x = (int) 2.5
//coercion
double x;
x = 2;
```
## Coercion of parameters
* on a function call
```
void f(double x){
    ...
}
f((byte) 1);
f((short) 2);
f('a');
```
* cause ambigious

# Memory layout
* method name is the pointer to where the method is located on the memory

# Method binding
* determing the method to execute
## Static binding
* resolved at compile time
## Dynamic Binding
* resolved at run-time

# vtable!!!

# template
```
template<class T>
...
```

# friend function and method
* get access of all private data and functions of other class
