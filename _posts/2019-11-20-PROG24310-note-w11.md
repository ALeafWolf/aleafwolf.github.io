# Polymophism
* Overriding: Subtype Polymorphism
- same type signature and method name in parent and child classes
- method in parent class is indicating as overriding, in C++ is keyword virtual
* Shadowing
- same type signature and method name in parent and child classes
- **but** method in parent class is **not** indicating as overriding
* Overloading: Ad Hoc Polymorphism
- single method name having **several** alternative signatures
* Redefination
- same method name but different type signature in child class

# Subtype Polymorphism
## Upcasting
* cast up the inheritance hierarchy from a subtype to a super type
```
Dog dog;
dog = new HoundDog();
dog = new Beagle();
dog = new Bassett();
```
## Late Binding
* in Method Binding

# Coercion
* an impicit type conversion
```
//explict type conversion
int x;
x = (int) 2.5
//coercion
double x;
x = 2;
```
## Coercion of parameters
* on a function call
```
void f(double x){
    ...
}
f((byte) 1);
f((short) 2);
f('a');
```
* cause ambigious

# Memory layout
* method name is the pointer to where the method is located on the memory

# Method binding
* determing the method to execute
## Static binding
* early binding
* resolved at compile time
* resolution based on static type of the object(s)
## Dynamic Binding
* late binding
* resolved at run-time
* resolution based on dynamic type of the object(s)

# vtable!!!

# Dynamic dispatch
* to lookup the appropriate function to call at the run-time
* polymorphism can be used to extend the functionality of an existing method using it

# template
```
template<class T>
...
```

# Self-reference
* objects are able to refer to themselves
* "this" is a pointer to the object that are inside of

# friend function and method
* get access of all private data and functions of other class

# Template classes and collections
* vector: flexible-size array
* deque: double-ended queue
* list: doubly linked list
* forward_list: singly linked list
* array: fixed-size array
* string: similar to vector which contains chars
