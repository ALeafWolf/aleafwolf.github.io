# General Introduction To Wireless Network Priciple
* IEEE 802.11 = "Wi-Fi" (a brand name used in market)
* **RF = Radio Frequency**
## Wireless Data Communications
* Satellite
- transmit date over very long distance
- has repeater in itself
- simply **repeats** the same signal to another location
- transimission times is ~250 milliseconds
* WAN
- Cellular Networks
  - in network, each "cell" handle a number of users
  - transmission towers are spread throughout a geographical area
  - **the same radio frequency channels can be reused by another tower**
- Wireless Wide Area Networks
  - WLAN
  - AP
  - NIC
* Wireless LAN
- 
* PAN (Wireless Personal Area Network)
- 
## Standards Organizations
* ITU-R
- set the rules for what the user can do with a radio transmitter (global hierarchy for management of the RF spectrum worldwide)
- manage and regulate frequencies, power levels and transmission methods through five administrative regions
* IEEE
- creates standards for compatibility and coexistence between networking equipment
* IETF
- creating Internet standards
- many of standards are wireless networking and security related
* Wi-Fi Alliance
- performs certification testing to make sure wireless networking equipment comforms to the 802.11 WLAN communication guidelines (similar to the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard)
* ISO
- create the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
- an architechtural model for data communications
