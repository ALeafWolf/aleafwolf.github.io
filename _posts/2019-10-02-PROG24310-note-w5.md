# String in C
## Pointers and Arrays in C
* int x[5] = {0}; //x = &x[0]
* //*x = x[0], *(x+1) = x[1]
 - array is a pointer
* impossible to pass a whole array as parameter in C, **pass the memory address (pointer) instead**
## sizeof()
* return type size_t (size in byte, as int), how much memory is used
* on 32 bit OS/compiler, it is an alias for **unsigned int**
* on 64 bit OS/compiler, it is an alias for **unsigned long**
## Character
* int a = 'c'; char b = 2;
 - single char as int based on ASCII code
* a byte can hold 256 numbers(127-0-(-127))
## String
* char color[] = "blue"; **// equal to char color[] = {'b', 'l', 'u', 'e', '\0'};**
## scanf()
