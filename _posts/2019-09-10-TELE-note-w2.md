# Radio Frequency signal
* Electromagnetic wave
 - low frequency: travel further
 - high frequency: dies quicker
* generated by radiating AC signal out of an antenna
* transmitter: generate waves
* receivers: accept waves
* wireless channel: the transmit medium
 - 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz channel
## characteristics
* amplitude: ex. volume of radio
- strength or power of the signal
- RF amplitude corresponds ot the electrical field of the wave
- reduced amplitude for receiving compare to transmitting
* frequency
- in RF, measured as the number of alternation of wave over 1 sec period
 - Hz (1 cycle/sec), kHz, MHz, GHz
* wavelength (λ)
- λ = c(speed of light)/f(frequency)
* phase: starting point, relevant with another signal to compare to
- in phase: two waves with the peaks in exact alignment
- out of phase: two waves with the peaks not in exact alignment
- nulling (cancel each other): 2 waves are 1 degree differ
## behaviors
* wave propagation: movement or motion of RF waves as they pass through the medium
* absorption: not reflected and diffracted by the object
- most common RF behavior
- denser materials will absorb more RF signal
- a leading cause of **attenuation**
- directly effects the amplitude of the wave
* reflection
- **cause of multipath signal**
* scattering: multiple reflections
- occurs then the wavelength is larger than pieces of the medium the signal is hitting
* refraction: signal passes through a medium with a different density
* diffraction: bending of an RF signal around an object
- caused by a partial blockage of the RF signal
- multipath
* loss(attenuation): weakening of the RF signal
- caused include:
 - propagation related
 - circuitry related
* free space path loss(FSPL): attenuation of a signal as it **travels**
- loss of signal strength is logarithmic, not linear
- 6 dB rule = doubling the distance will result in a loss of power by 6 dB
- FSPL = 32.44 + (20log(f) + (20log(D)))
 - D: distance in km between the antennas
 - F: frequency

* multipath
* gain(amplification): increase signal's strength or amplitude, **not improve its quality**
  - usually achieved by the use of an amplifier
   - antennae: passive amplifiers
   - some inject power
  - two types of gain
   - active: adding additional power
   - passive: focusing the RF signal, typically by an antenna
## Communications fundamentals
 - Carrier Signal: carry information
  - pure carrier signal (unchanged or unmodulated) form does not carry information
 - Modulation: changing of a carrier signal
  - ex. AM: analog signal for all
  - ex. FM: vary the frequency of the signal
 - Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK)
 - Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)
 - Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)
 - Multiple Phase-Shift Keying (M-PSK)
 - Binary Phase-Shift Keying (B-PSK) ???
 - Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (Q-PSK) ???
 - adaptive modulation ???
