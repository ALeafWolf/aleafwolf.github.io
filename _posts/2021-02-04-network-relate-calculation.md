## Unit Conversion
### Frequency
```
1Hz = 10e-3 kHz = 10e-6 MHz = 10e-9 GHz
```
### Second
* us = microsecond
```
1s = 10e3 ms = 10e6 us
```
### Meter
```
1m = 10e2 cm = 10e3 mm = 10e6 um
```
### dBm and mW, dBW and W
```
n dBm = 10en mW
+3 dBm = *2 mW
-3 dBm = /2 mW

W = 10e3 mW



```
## Calculation
### Period, Frequency and Wavelength
* T = period
* f = frequency
* λ = wavelength
* C = Speed of Light (299,792,458 m/s) 
```
T = 1/f
λ = C/f
T(s), f(Hz), λ(m)
```
### Phase difference between two waves
* ø = phace angle difference
* f = frequency
* Δt = time delay between two waveform
* [reference](https://voltage-disturbance.com/power-quality/calculating-phase-difference-between-two-waves/)

```
ø = 360 * f * Δt 

```
