# RF Measurements
## Components of RF Communications
* Transmitter: initial component that for creating a wireless signal
 - size and components different for digital (require encodes the data) and analog signal
* Antenna: interfance between electrical and EM signals
 - **acts as a bi-directional passive amplifier**
* Receiver: final component in wireless signaling
 - decodes carrier signal ino 1's and 0's
* Intentional Radiator (IR): intentionally emits FR energy by radiation or induction
 - regulate the maximum IR power (by government). it's measured from the transmitter to the base of the antenna including all components except the antenna itself
* Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP): the highest RF signal strength that is radiated by a specific antenna

## Unit of Power and Comparison
* Linear units
 - Watt (W) = 1 Volt x 1 Amp (Ampere, how fast the current flowing)
 - Miliwatt (mW)
* Log units
 - Decibel (dB): used to measure change in signal strength with eigher gain or loss
 - dBi: value that compared to what an isotropic radiator would generate
 - dBd: an additional reference used by antenna makers to describe change related to antenna gain, relative to a dipole antenna
 - dBm
* **Absolute measure:** W, mW, dBm
* **Relative measure:** dB, dBi, dBd
## Power Calculation 
* General relationship
 - P = voltage x current
 - P = V^2 x R
 - R: Resistance
* In communication, generally R is take to be 1
 - P = V^2
* **dB = 10log10(P1/P2)**
* **multiply in linear, plus in log**
- 10 mW = 10 dBm
- 40 (10x2x2) mW = 16 dBm (10+3+3)
- 50 mW (40x10/2/2/2) = 17 dBm (17+10-3-3-3)

## The rule of 10's and 3's
* x10mW => +10dB
* x2mW => +3dB
* /10mW => -10dB
* /2mW => -3dB
* if a value contains both 10's and 3's, such as a 13 dBi gain antenna, use the 10's first
## Example
* 100 mW -- -3 dB -- +10 dBi
* solution:
 - linear: 100 mW x 1/2 = 50 mWx100 = 500mW
 - log scale: 
* 50 mW -- -1 dB -- 5dBi
* solution
 - linear: 50/10 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 40 mW (-1 db = -10+3+3+3)
  - 40 mW x 10^2 / 2^5 = 125mW (5dBi = 2x10-3x5)
 - log scale: 10log 50 - 1 + 5 = 21 dBm
## Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
* **SNR** is the difference in decibels between the received signal and the abckground noice level (noise floor)
* **Noise Floor** is the ambient or background level of radio energy on a specific channel
## Receive Sensitivity
* refers to the power level of an RF signal required to be sucessfully received by the receiver radio 
![Mbps to dBm](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w3-3.png)
## Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
* a method of measuring RF energy on circuitry
* defined by the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard as a relative metric used by 802.11 radios to measure signal strength
![Signal strength vs. noise](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w3-4.png)
## Link Budget
* The sum all of gains and losses from the transmitting system through the air to the intended receiving system

# Antenna Concepts
## Azimuth and Elevation Charts
![Azimuth and Elevation Charts](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w3-5.png)
* Radiation patterns
* created in controlled environment
* **Azimuth chart = H-plane = top-down view**
* **Elevation chart = E-plane = side view**
## Interpreting Polar Charts
* 
## Beamwidth
* measurement of how broad or narrow the focus of an antenna is
* measured both horizontally and vertically
* measurement from the strongest point on polar chart to the half power (-3dB or /2 power) points
* measured in degrees
## Antenna Types
* Omnidirectional: radiates in all directions, provides general coverage
* Semidirectional: wide directional focus
 - horizontal beamwidth < 180 degress
* Highly directional: narrow directional focus
* **antennas focus both transmitted and received signals**
## Antenna Arrays
* Group of two or more antennas integrated to provide coverage
* perform beamforming: concentrating RF energy
### Types of beamforming
* Static
![static](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w3-6.png)
* Dynamic
![dynamic](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w3-7.png)
* Transmit: multiple phase-shifted signals are transmitted to arrive in-phase at the location of the receiver
## Fresnel Zone
![fresnel zone](/assets/images/post_images/tele-w3-8.png)
## Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
* Ex. 8x8 MIMO
* used by 802.11n and 802.11ac radios
## Regulatory Compliance
* switch among antennas
* fixed or lower gain, same type of antenna
