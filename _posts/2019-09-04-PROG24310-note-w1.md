# Intro
* Data (in cs) = a sequence of bits
* unassignment and assignment data type (?)
 - 1 byte = 8 bits
 - unassigned ...
* 8000+ programming language
* choose the right language
 - C is the best for systems programming
 - PHP is easier than the Ruby for web dev
* Properties for programming languages
 - Syntax
   - grammar
   - vocab
   - how are syntax errors detected
 - Names **(research it from textbook)**
   - scope
   - visibility
   - type
   - lifetime
 - Types
   - simple: numbers characters, booleans
   - structured: Strings, lists, trees, hash tables...
   - **type system**
     - ex. 1 + 'a' in different language
 - Semantics: meaning of a program
* Paradigm: a pattern for a pl to follow
 - **imperative**: instructs the machine how to change the state
  - **follows the von Neumann-Eckert model**
  - procedural
 - **object-oriented**
  - encapsulation
  - inheritance
  - polymorphism
   - ex. same code for different object, might perform differently
 - **functional**
  - functional composition
  - recursion
  - ex. F#
 - **declarative (logic)**: declare the properties of the desired result **???**
  - functional
  - logic
  - mathematical
* SQL IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
# Algorithms
* Types:
  - sorting and searching
  - dynamic
  - graph
  - recursive
  - backtracking
  - other
* **Turing complete**
* no use of PHP in banking system due to its poor relibility
